# Webex Polls- ATP files for Alta3 classes!

If polls exist for a course, you'll find the course name above.  

Each directory should contain the following:  

- One `.atp` file for each day of class. Day 1 is "get to know you" questions, subsequent days are quiz questions on the previous day's content.
- Many questions are based on code which must be displayed on the instructor's screen- these are the `.txt` files in the course directory. Just display those questions in a notepad file on your screen, then "freeze" your WebEx screenshare while students work on the survey.
- Each survey ends with the following three questions:
    
        1. How was the pace of class yesterday?

        ðŸ˜« Too fast! 
        ðŸ˜… Fast, but I was keeping up! 
        ðŸ˜ƒ Good! Not too fast or too slow!
        ðŸ™‚ Slow, but the challenges are keeping my interest, so it's OK! 
        ðŸ¥± Too slow for me.


        2. How difficult was class yesterday?

        ðŸ˜« Way too advanced... 
        ðŸ˜… Very challenging, but I was keeping up! 
        ðŸ˜ƒ Just right!
        ðŸ™‚ Easy, but the challenges are keeping me engaged! 
        ðŸ¥± Far too easy.

        3. Welcome back to training! Do you have any questions, requests, or issues to share?
